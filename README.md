A Single Page Application For Online Ordering


## Introduction
HellaFresh. is a single page application with a Ruby on Rails backend, and a Javascript frontend designed to help companies with having a functional online ordering system. This early build has sample seed data for a restaurant, and has a fully functional product and menu display system, along with a cart. The app allows a user to view the menu, and add items to and from their cart. Future expansion will allow for a company to create an admin account, upload products, and display the menu based on a metaprogrammed category builder. It will have full user login, and ordering functionality in a templated shell.
